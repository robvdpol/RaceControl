Race Control is an open source [F1TV](https://f1tv.formula1.com) desktop client for Windows. It can be used to watch content (both live broadcasts and replays) in the highest quality available, using either the built-in player or an external media player of your choice. The goal of this project is to improve the overall experience by implementing features not found in the official website and apps, while still being easy to set up and use.

**This app is unofficial and is not associated in any way with the Formula 1 companies. F1, FORMULA ONE, FORMULA 1, FIA FORMULA ONE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP, GRAND PRIX and related marks are trade marks of Formula One Licensing BV.**

## Features

## FAQ
#### Why do I get a login popup? What credentials do I use to login?
You need an F1TV account to watch streams. If you want to watch race replays, an F1TV Access subscription is required. If you want to watch live sessions, an F1TV Pro subscription is required. You can create an account and subscribe at http://f1tv.formula1.com.

#### What happens with my credentials when I login?
Your login credentials are stored locally in the Windows Credential Manager, so you don't have to login every time you start the application. If you wish to switch to a different account, press the button 'Log out' under the 'Options' section. Your stored credentials will be removed from your system and you will be asked to login again.

#### How can I move an internal player window?
You can move an internal player window by clicking and dragging the actual video or the control bar.

#### Do I need to install MPV separately to use it with Race Control?
No, Race Control comes with a recent version of MPV included in the release.

#### Why is the VLC button not shown?
You need to have VLC media player installed on your machine. The location of your VLC installation will be read from the Windows registry.

#### Why is the MPC-HC button not shown?
You need to have MPC-HC media player installed on your machine. The location of your MPC-HC installation will be read from the Windows registry.

#### Why is the Cast button not shown?
You need to scan for Chromecast devices first.

#### Where does Race Control store my settings and video layout? Will they be retained when I upgrade Race Control?
Your settings and video layout are stored in JSON-files, which are saved to *%LOCALAPPDATA%\RaceControl* (usually located at *C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Local\RaceControl*). When you upgrade Race Control your settings and video layout will be retained.

#### Where is the log file located?
The log file is located at *%LOCALAPPDATA%\RaceControl\RaceControl.log*.

#### Can you add support for my favourite media player?
Maybe, please create an issue (feature request) and I will consider it. As a workaround, you can use the Copy-button to generate a tokenized link to the stream that is copied to your clipboard. Open the link with a media player of your choice to watch the stream. Note: the media player needs to properly support the HTTP Live Streaming (HLS) protocol.
